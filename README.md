# BotWGuardian
A repo holding my Unity package for the BotW inspired Guardian


# How to use

The scripts are designed to be super simple to use and integrate easily to anything. All you need to do is: 
1. Import the package 
1. Put the Guardian prefab in your scene
1. Fill the Enemy field with a transform
1. Fill the Center field with another transform. This is used for setting the "walkable area". It's very basic and should be improved with some sort of pathfinding. 
1. Enjoy ! 

I'd be glad to hear any comments, thoughts or remark about this package
